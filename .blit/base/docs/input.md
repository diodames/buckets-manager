# Input

Read input inside `update()`. BLIT386 gives every player simple, named buttons that work the same whether the player
uses a keyboard or a gamepad.

## Face buttons and the D-pad

The button names are constants on `BT`:

- Directions: `BT.BTN_LEFT`, `BT.BTN_RIGHT`, `BT.BTN_UP`, `BT.BTN_DOWN`
- Action buttons: `BT.BTN_A`, `BT.BTN_B`, `BT.BTN_X`, `BT.BTN_Y`

For one-player games, the player number is `0`.

### Held vs. just pressed

There are three questions you can ask, and the difference matters:

```js
update() {
    // isDown: true every frame the button is held. Use for movement.
    if (BT.isDown(BT.BTN_RIGHT, 0)) {
        this.x += 2;
    }

    // isPressed: true only on the one frame the button goes down. Use for jumping, firing, menu choices.
    if (BT.isPressed(BT.BTN_A, 0)) {
        this.jump();
    }

    // isReleased: true only on the one frame the button comes back up.
    if (BT.isReleased(BT.BTN_A, 0)) {
        this.stopChargingJump();
    }
}
```

On a keyboard, the arrow keys map to the D-pad and Space maps to `BTN_A` by default, so these work with no extra setup.

## Raw keyboard keys

If you want a specific key by name, use its code (the same names the browser uses, like `'KeyW'`, `'Space'`,
`'ArrowUp'`, `'Enter'`):

```js
if (BT.isKeyDown('KeyW')) {
  this.y -= 2;
}
if (BT.isKeyPressed('Enter')) {
  this.start();
}
```

`isKeyDown` is "held", `isKeyPressed` and `isKeyReleased` are the one-frame edges, exactly like the buttons above.

## Mouse, touch, and pen

These share one set of calls (a "pointer"). Slot `0` is the main one:

```js
if (BT.isPointerActive(0)) {
  const p = BT.pointerPos(0); // a Vector2i in screen pixels
  // ...use p.x and p.y...
}
```
