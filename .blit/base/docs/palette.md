# Colors and the palette

BLIT386 is "palette-first". Instead of drawing with a color directly, you fill a small set of numbered slots with colors
once, then draw using the slot numbers. This is how old game consoles worked, and it unlocks tricks like recoloring the
whole screen by changing one slot.

## Make a palette in init()

```js
async init() {
    // A palette with room for 16 colors. Slot 0 is always transparent, so use 1 and up.
    this.palette = BT.paletteCreate(16);

    // Put colors in slots. Color32(red, green, blue) with each value from 0 to 255.
    this.palette.set(1, new Color32(230, 80, 60));   // a warm red
    this.palette.set(2, new Color32(20, 24, 40));    // a dark blue background
    this.palette.set(3, new Color32(120, 200, 120)); // a soft green
    this.palette.set(4, new Color32(240, 240, 255)); // near-white for text

    // Hand the palette to the engine. From now on, drawing uses slot numbers.
    BT.paletteSet(this.palette);

    return true;
}
```

## Draw with slot numbers

```js
render() {
    BT.clear(2);                                       // slot 2 = background
    BT.drawRectFill(new Rect2i(10, 10, 32, 32), 1);    // slot 1 = red
    BT.systemPrint(new Vector2i(8, 8), 4, 'Hi');       // slot 4 = near-white
}
```

## Color32 quick reference

- `new Color32(r, g, b)` - red, green, blue, each 0 to 255.
- `new Color32(r, g, b, a)` - add alpha (0 transparent, 255 solid).
- Handy presets are properties, not calls: `Color32.white`, `Color32.black`, `Color32.red`, `Color32.green`,
  `Color32.blue` (no parentheses).

## The transparent slot

Slot 0 is always see-through. Drawing with slot 0 draws nothing, which is occasionally useful, but for visible colors
start at slot 1.

## Changing a color later

The palette is live. Change a slot during the game and everything drawn with that slot changes on the next frame:

```js
update() {
    if (this.hurt) {
        this.palette.set(1, new Color32(255, 255, 255)); // flash the player white
    }
}
```
