# AGENTS.md - working on a BLIT386 game

<!-- blit-kit:managed:start -->
<!-- Everything between the managed markers is owned by /kit and will be rewritten by a future
     `npx blit agents sync`. Put your own notes in the "Your notes" section below the end marker. -->

This file is the home base for anyone (a person or an AI assistant) working on this game. It is short on purpose: it
tells you how a BLIT386 game is shaped, the rules to follow, and which doc to open when you need detail. Read the linked
doc only when the task needs it - do not load everything at once.

BLIT386 is a palette-first 2D pixel engine. You draw with small whole-number coordinates and numbered colors, and the
engine puts pixels on a `<canvas>`. It runs on WebGPU when available and falls back to plain Canvas 2D otherwise, so a
game always renders.

## The shape of every game

A game is one class with up to four methods, handed to `bootstrap()`:

```js
import { bootstrap, BT, Color32, Rect2i, Vector2i } from 'blit386';

class Game {
  // configure() {}              // optional; omit to use the default 320x240 screen at 60 FPS
  async init() {
    // runs once at startup; load assets and set up colors here
    return true; // return true when setup succeeded
  }
  update() {} // runs ~60 times a second; read input, move things, change state
  render() {} // runs ~60 times a second; draw the current frame
}

bootstrap(Game);
```

`update()` decides what happens; `render()` only draws. Keep them separate.

## Hard rules (do not break these)

- **Whole numbers for positions and sizes.** Use `Vector2i(x, y)` for points and `Rect2i(x, y, w, h)` for boxes. Never
  pass raw floats as screen coordinates.
- **Use the `BT` namespace** for everything the engine does (`BT.clear`, `BT.drawRectFill`, `BT.isDown`, ...). Do not
  reach for internal classes.
- **Colors are palette slots.** Create a palette, put colors in numbered slots (slot 0 is always transparent, so start
  at 1), and draw with those numbers. See `docs/palette.md`.
- **`await` async loads.** Anything that loads (fonts, sprites) returns a promise; forgetting `await` is the most common
  beginner bug.
- **No fullscreen post-process effects in a starter.** Effects like CRT need WebGPU and do not run on the Canvas 2D
  fallback. Keep starters working everywhere.
- **No emoji** anywhere in code, comments, or text.

## When you need detail, open the right doc

| You want to...                                   | Read                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Install Node, run the game, edit your first line | `docs/getting-started.md`       |
| Understand init/update/render and timing         | `docs/basics.md`                |
| Clear the screen, draw rectangles, lines, text   | `docs/drawing.md`               |
| Read the keyboard, mouse, or a gamepad           | `docs/input.md`                 |
| Make and use colors (palette, slots)             | `docs/palette.md`               |
| Fix a blank screen, an error, a broken change    | `docs/when-something-breaks.md` |

The full engine reference lives at https://github.com/blit386/blit386 - only go there if these local docs do not answer
the question.

## Running the game

From the project folder:

- `npm run dev` (or `pnpm run dev`) - start the game and open it in your browser.
- `npx blit run` - the same thing, the friendly way.
- `npx blit doctor` - check your setup if something seems off.
- `npx blit upgrade` - update BLIT386 to the latest version (and offer to fix any renamed API names for you).
- `npx blit migrate` - update old BLIT386 names in your game to the current ones. Add `--write` to apply the changes.

The `blit` helper is installed inside the project (it ships with `/kit`), so it is not on the system PATH. Always invoke
it through `npx blit ...` (or `pnpm exec blit ...`); plain `blit` only works inside package scripts.

## Good habits

- Change one small thing, then look at the browser. Fast loops beat big rewrites.
- Keep `update()` cheap: it runs 60 times a second. Avoid creating lots of new objects every frame in hot paths.
- The starter game (`src/game.js`) is yours to change. Read its comments first; they explain every line.

## Working with an AI assistant

If you use **Claude Code**, open `CLAUDE.md` for the full project guide. Rules loaded automatically from
`.claude/rules/` tell Claude the engine's naming conventions. Skills in `.claude/skills/` are loaded on demand.

If you use **Cursor**, `.cursor/rules/` loads rules automatically when you open the project.

For **other assistants** (Zed, Copilot, Windsurf, and others), this file is your assistant's home base.

Did not set up an assistant when you started the game? Run `npx blit agents add claude` or `npx blit agents add cursor`
to add its files now.

Run `npx blit agents sync` after a kit update (`npx blit upgrade`) to refresh the assistant files.

<!-- blit-kit:managed:end -->

## Your notes

Everything below the managed end marker is yours. Write down decisions, todos, or project-specific rules here - for
yourself or for your AI assistant. Kit updates (`npx blit agents sync`) rewrite only the managed part above and never
touch this section.
